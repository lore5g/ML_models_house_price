# **🏠 House Prices — End-to-End Machine Learning Project**

Author: Lorena Galvan – Data Scientist  

Problem Type: Supervised Regression  
Objective: Predict residential property sale prices using a house prices dataset from kaggle (https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/lespin/house-prices-dataset/data)

## **🚀 Project Overview**

This project implements a full end-to-end data science workflow, from raw data exploration to model evaluation and optimization. The goal is to build a robust regression model capable of accurately predicting house prices while demonstrating strong skills in:

- Advanced feature engineering

- Handling missing data systematically

- Statistical reasoning

- Models comparison and validation

- Regularization and generalization control

## 📈 Technical Overview
### Exploratory Data Analysis


The target variable (SalePrice) was right-skewed → log transformation improved normality. Strong correlations found with:

- OverallQual

- GrLivArea

- GarageCars
- Outliers in living area were detected and treated to stabilize variance

### Model Performance

**🔹 Polynomial Regression 2nd grade**  

Results:  
- R²: 0.91  
- RMSE: $23,269  
- The model captured the main trend but showed sensitivity to outliers and non-linear effects.

**🔹 Logistic Regression of the variable: Basement Full Bathroom**  

Results:  
- R²: 0.88  
- MAE: 0.12 (Variable takes the values: 0, 1, 2)  
- The model provided interpretable decision boundaries but was limited in capturing complex relationships.   
- **Confusion Matrix**

**🔹 Decision Tree**  

Results:  
- Train and Test Accuracy: 0.66, 0.62  
- Train and Test F1 weighted: 0.62, 0.56  
- the model achieved moderate predictive performance, with a small gap between training and testing accuracy, indicating mild overfitting.
